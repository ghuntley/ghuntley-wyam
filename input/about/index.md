I'm Geoffrey Huntley, an Australian Microsoft Regional Director and also a Microsoft Most Valuable Professional for Visual Studio. I don't work for Microsoft, but they're kind enough to recognise my community contributions by way of their award programs which I've been an awardee of since 2016. I get to interact with some fantastic people building their best products and then share what I know about creating secure applications for the web with the broader community.
