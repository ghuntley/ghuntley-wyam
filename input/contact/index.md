# Email: [ghuntley@ghuntley.com](mailto:ghuntley@ghuntley.com)
This is the easiest way if you want to reach out and I can usually respond pretty promptly.

# YouTube: [geoffreyhuntley](https://www.youtube.com/c/GeoffreyHuntley)
My background is pretty well covered for the last couple of decades there. I accept connections from people I've met, worked with, spoken with or otherwise had enough interaction to feel that I can call them a professional contact. I don't respond to requests from people I don't know.


# Twitter: [geoffreyhuntley](https://twitter.com/geoffreyhuntley)

This is my primary means of broadcasting things to the world so please follow me there. I do read my DMs and allow them from people I don't follow, but would prefer email if you're reaching out from the blue about something. I don't see every mention so you may not get a reply via a public tweet.

# Skype
If I'm scheduled to talk with you, find me on Skype via my email address. For anything else, please use email or Twitter, I keep Skype connections to those who really need to communicate over that channel.

# What I'll definitely respond to
I'm happy to make comments to media on any breaking security stories, I usually like to talk.

Genuine queries about speaking at events will get a response, even if I can't accept the invite.

# What I may not respond to
I try and respond to technical queries but would prefer you try asking on Stack Overflow first.

I probably won't respond to queries to check out your [insert awesome thing here] simply due to the volume of these requests I get.

If your message doesn't explicitly look like it needs a response or it's vague or not clear what the purpose is, you may not hear back from me.

If you're looking for data in a data breach (yes, even your own), read why I won't be able to help you before emailing me asking for data!

# What I won't respond to
No, you cannot guest-post on troyhunt.com.
No, I will not promote your infographic for you.
No, I will not link to your [insert whatever you think is awesome here].
