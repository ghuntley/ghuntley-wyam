Remember when Apple was all about [skeuomorphism](https://github.com/ghuntley/ios-artwork/blob/master/iPad%20Simulator%205.0%20artwork/Contacts~ipad%20app/Default-Landscape~ipad.png?raw=true) or that release that [added the selfie](https://github.com/ghuntley/ios-artwork/blob/master/iPad%209.2%20artwork/Camera%20app/TakeSelfie-OrbHW%402x.png)? For the last couple of years I've been maintaining an archive of design assets.

Today the archive was [updated to include all versions up to and including v9.2](https://github.com/ghuntley/ios-artwork).
