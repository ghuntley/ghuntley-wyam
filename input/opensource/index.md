Title: Open Source
Image: cover.jpg
---

Every open source project loves new contributors and there are lots and lots of people who would love to contribute to Open Source, but don't know how.

So what is missing? There is a huge difference between welcoming Pull Requests and creating a [contributor-friendly community](https://lwn.net/Articles/688542/). That's why I maintain a curated backlog of tasks for people who have never contributed to the project before or are completely new to open-source. Often it takes more time to prepare these tasks than to actually implement them. I will invest in you, in hope that you will stick around and pay it forward when you are ready.


If you’re being harassed, noticed someone else being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact us immediately. Your reports will be taken seriously and will not be dismissed or argued with. All members, committers and volunteers in this community are required to act according to the Code of Conduct. These guidelines help steer our interactions and strive to keep ReactiveUI a positive, growing project, community and help us provide and ensure a safe environment for everyone. When referring to a group of people, we aim to use gender-neutral terms like “team”, “folks”, “everyone”. (For details, we recommend this post).

    <p>
      ReactiveUI is a composable, cross-platform model-view-viewmodel framework for all .NET platforms that is inspired by functional reactive programming which is a paradigm that allows you to abstract mutable state away from your user interfaces, express the idea around a feature in one readable place and improve the testability of your application.

    <h3><a href="https://reactiveui.net/">Cake.Raygun</a><br></h3>
    <p>
      Objective-C debug symbols (dSYM) are essential to debugging Xamarin iOS application crashes. This Cake add-in uploads these symbols to <a href="https://raygun.io/">Raygun.io</a> which creates delightfully readable stack traces which aid you in tracking down those bugs. As Raygun adds additional functionality to their API, these features will also be made available in this add-in.

    <h3><a href="https://reactiveui.net/">GeoCoordinate</a><br></h3>
    <p>
      GeoCoordinate is a portable class library (in v1.1.x) or netstandard v1.1 (from v2.x.x) compatible implementation of System.Device.Location.GeoCoordinate. It is an exact 1:1 API compliant implementation and will be supported until MSFT sees it fit to embed the type. Which at that point this implementation will cease development/support and you will be able to simply remove this package and everything will still work.
