One of Australia's longest running BYO PC gaming LANS, and Sydney's largest LAN. Initially just a garage event among a group of friends from school as more and more people found out about it, it rapidly grew to a size which needed extensive organisation, venues, proper networking and power infrastructure. At the peak height of operation registration would open at 5:00pm and all 700 seats would be sold out by 5:06pm. SGL successfully ran the first ever eSports competition in Australia - The World Cyber Games.

Sydney Gamers League was founded in early 2001 and sold to CBN Media in late 2005.
